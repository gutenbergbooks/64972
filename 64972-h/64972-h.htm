  <h2 class='c004'>THE REVIEW OF A CENTURY;<br /> <span class='small'>OR,</span><br /> THE FRUIT OF FIVE THOUSAND YEARS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Victoria C. Woodhull leaves this country shortly for
Europe, and has prepared a lecture, which will be her
farewell utterance. Those who heard Mrs. Woodhull
recently at Paine Hall bear unanimous testimony to the
humanitarian character of her address; she is the advocate
of peculiar, because novel and original, views. A
<cite>Times</cite> reporter has obtained a full report of her farewell
address, and it is so full of instruction, and presents
new social ideas in so fresh and thoroughly effective a
manner, that no apology is needed for submitting it, <i>in
extenso</i>, to the public. It is entitled “The Review of
a Century; or, The Fruit of Five Thousand Years,”
and is as follows:—</p>
<p class='c006'>A hundred years ago, in an upper room in Philadelphia, five men
were gathered—men of noble bearing, of brilliant intellects, of
undoubted character. Their faces wore a look of stern determination,
as if the theme of their consideration was of matters of grave
import; was of matters destined to be the beginning of the most
important era that had ever dawned upon the earth. A century
and eighty years before, a single ship-load of men, women and
children, had landed on this virgin soil at Jamestown in Virginia;
and a few years later, another one at Plymouth-Rock in Massachusetts.
To these, additions had been made until the thirteen
States then numbered fully three million souls, upon whom “the
king” had imposed onerous taxation, and over whom he had
placed obnoxious rulers. The tea had been destroyed in Boston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>harbour, and the people were wrought up to the intensest pitch by
their oppressions. They had come from their native lands to
escape from tyranny, and were not disposed to brook it here. In
this wild, free land, they had become pregnant of liberty, and were
even then struggling in the throes of travail. These five men had
met to find a way in which the delivery might be safely made, so
that both the mother and the child should live to bless the world.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE EARLY FATHERS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Washington, Adams, Franklin, Rush, Paine—every one of them
immortal names—struggled with the task with which God had
entrusted them. They felt the great responsibility, and their faces,
as they looked into each other’s eyes, spoke their anxiety. Each
knew that every other as well as self had something in his heart
that he dared not utter. They looked inquiringly again and again
for some yielding in some face. But they hesitated all. And well
they might; for it was not the fate of three million people merely
that was in their hands, but the future destinies of the world. One
of these men had said but little; but the set features of his face
showed a stern resolve; showed that he was waiting for the proper
time in which to speak. He knew that it would fall to him to break
the way; to say the words which each one felt but dared not speak;
and speak at last he did; and they were the words of mighty import
that came forth from him; words that were to deliver the people
who had come to their full time—a birth that should herald a new
race of people to the world; and they came forth from him as if all
his powers were concentrated in the effort; as if that effort were
the last struggle of the mother to bring forth her child; and the
“four” caught up the child and became god-father to it, and they
bore it to the people. The people recognised it as their own; took
it to their hearts, and at once adopted it. Its name was—Revolution—Independence;
and the words rang up and down the wave-washed
shores, and fired the people with their inspiration—revolution
as the means, independence as the end.</p>

<p class='c009'>One hundred years have come and gone since that eventful day,
great with the future’s destinies. Its hundredth anniversary has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>passed, and forty million people have commemorated the work of
those five men, of those three million people:—commemorated it
by reaffirming the truths that then were uttered for the first time in
the new world; commemorated them by brilliant flights of oratory, by
firing cannons and profuse displays of “stars and stripes” harmoniously
blended with the flags of almost every other nation of the globe,
whose sons and daughters were participating in the glory of the
day; with feasting, fireworks; with general rejoicing everywhere.
As if with a universal assent, these swarming millions re-echoed
with a will the words that that stern man had uttered on that
never-to-be-forgotten day a hundred years ago.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUR COMMERCIAL GREATNESS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>But those three million people have expanded into forty-four
million; and the thirteen States to thirty-eight, besides ten territories
and one district. The country now, excepting the stretch from the
west shore of Lake Superior, and from the south-west point of Texas
westward to the ocean, has available for commercial purposes, a
continuous water-front of not less than fifteen thousand miles,
equal to that of the whole of Europe. It is five thousand miles from
east to west, and four thousand from north to south. It contains
vast ranges of mountains, the longest river in the world, and the
most fertile plains. Its climate is so varied and extensive that it
produces almost everything that is grown anywhere in the world—the
fruits of the tropics as well as of the latitudes north and south;
and it will be the granary from which the world must ultimately
draw its bread. It has all the different forms of mineral wealth—gold,
silver, copper, iron, lead, besides coal, oil and salt. No
other country on the globe can begin to compare with it in the
variety of its products; it combines the utility of them all. It is
as if all others had contributed their choicest seeds, as they have
their peoples, to fill up the variety with which this should be
blessed. In whatever sense it may be regarded, it is the
great country of the world. No other can for a moment enter into
comparison with it save in some single sense—while this combines
the greatnesses of them all. Blessed with such a country—with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>land such as God promised to His chosen people—“a land flowing
with milk and honey,” how ought the people to have returned their
gratitude to Him Who gave it? Or rather, how have they done
so?</p>

<p class='c009'>Having already entered upon a second century, there can be
no more appropriate a time in which to see what use there has been
made of the “ten talents” with which the Great Husbandman has
entrusted us; to see how we have shown our love for Him by that
which we have given to our brethren; to see whether from His bounteous
gifts to all, a part has stolen the inheritance from others, and
when His servants have been sent whether they have been beaten
away empty; whether some, having an abundance, have “shut up
their bowels of compassion” though seeing their brothers had need;
whether they have “fought the good fight,” whether they have
“kept the faith” and whether they are entitled to the crown
which St. Paul bespoke for them that love God.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHAT ARE OUR CENTENNIAL FRUITS?</h3>

<p class='c008'>In other words, what is the condition politically, industrially,
socially, religiously? Is it such as will make us rejoice in its
review? Are our centennial fruits such as He would pronounce
good, so that we may rest upon the seventh day from all our
labours?</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, what have we done politically? It is to
government that people largely owe their prosperity or adversity—a
good government meaning continuous prosperity; a bad one
continuous adversity, or else alternate seasons of each, in which
the latter consume the fruits of the former; in which the people
see-saw, up and down each decade; in which, like the Israelites,
the people journey in the wilderness “forty years” in search of the
promised land, to which God would bring them suddenly, if they
would keep all His commandments, and neither worship nor sacrifice
to the “Golden Calf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The last estimates are, that there are forty-four million people
now in the United States. It is by no means, however, to be
inferred that these are all citizens who constitute the “sovereignty;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>from whom the Government has its source, and upon whom it
sheds its benignant rays. For, although the constitution declares
that “all persons born or naturalised in the United States, and
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens;” and although
there are unreversed decisions of the Supreme Court, which declare
that every person in the country “constitutes a part of the political
sovereignty,” and that every such person is entitled to every right,
civil and political, enjoyed by anyone in the State,—notwithstanding
all this authority and law upon the subject, only a minority of
the 44,000,000 are really citizens. For, in the Dred Scott decision,
the law of citizenship was declared to be this: “To be a citizen is
to have the actual possession and enjoyment, or the perfect right
to the acquisition and enjoyment, of an entire equality of privileges,
civil and political.” Dred Scott did not possess or enjoy these
rights; therefore the court held that he was not a citizen. As
this is the law of citizenship now, we must conclude that only
those are citizens who have “the actual possession and enjoyment,
or the perfect right of acquisition and enjoyment, of an entire
equality of privileges, civil and political,” the Constitution to the
contrary notwithstanding. The Constitution in the hands of “the
few” is a mere toy with the plain language of which they play,
making it to mean anything or nothing as it suits them now and
then. Later we shall see that this was what it was intended to be;
that it was a fraud, a cheat, from the beginning, into which
neither the letter nor spirit of the Declaration of Independence ever
entered.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHO ARE CITIZENS?</h3>

<p class='c008'>But who are citizens? Why, those who possess and enjoy, or
who have the right to acquire and enjoy, an equality of political and
civil privileges. Only certain classes of men possess these rights.
These certain classes having possessed themselves of the machinery
of the Government, tread upon the Constitution and spit upon the
declarations of the Supreme Court. They have stolen the birthright
of the “many,” and, putting their thumbs to their noses, say
“Help yourselves if you can.” The despoiled people are not able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to help themselves now, but let these usurpers be warned that the
judgments of God are upon this nation, and that He will come to
help those who cannot help themselves against such tyranny;
come to deliver His people out of the hands of the “Egyptians,”
who have imposed tasks upon them grievous to be borne; come to
send them some “Moses,” who shall cause “Pharaoh” to let the
people go, and who shall bring down from “Sinai’s Mount”
a new and better code of laws.</p>

<p class='c009'>But who are not citizens, who neither possess or enjoy, nor have
the right to acquire or enjoy, an equality of privileges, civil and
political? There are three classes of these people: Indians,
Chinese, and women, and these constitute by a million more than
one-half of all the people. The political lords have selected nice
company for the women to keep politically, and yet they put on
such monstrous airs if they are told that in this matter they show
no respect for their mothers, wives and daughters. Here is a subject
for some Raphael, who should have reduced it to canvas and exhibited
it at the Centennial, in honour of the mothers and daughters
of the land. Upon the one hand there should have been grouped
the women of the country, flanked upon the right and left by
Indians and Chinese, and the subject named—Political Slaves;
while upon the other the citizens should have been grouped, and
labelled Political Sovereigns.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The principles under the inspiration of which this government
had its birth, are set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
They were when realized by the people, when incorporated into
the organic law, to give them independence; and they were
thought to be of so much importance that the people fought a long
and bloody war to acquire a right to their possession and enjoyment.
Who can think of Bunker Hill, of Brandy-wine, of Princeton,
of Valley Forge, of Yorktown, think of those long eight years
of alternate hope and despair, and not feel that the price paid for
independence was too great to have it limited to a mere minority
of the people, when it was purchased for the whole; was too great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>a price to pay for principles that were to be restricted to fewer than
half of the descendants of those who paid it. Our fathers
would have never fought for the liberty to have a King or an
aristocratic ruler of their own. They endured the hardships and
privations of that war for independence for themselves and their
posterity. Nothing less than this was the inspiration of those
years of suffering, nothing less than this could have given them
inspiration to gain their independence.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this was scarcely more than won, before those from whom
this inspiration came were doomed to see their work robbed of
half its value. At the convention that met to frame a government,
there were men whose minds were too narrow to grasp the
significance of the truths which had been the inspiration of the
people; and which had sustained them through the war. They were
men bred and born in English customs. They were not willing
to make a complete departure from the established legal forms of
the mother country, and make the Declaration, the inspiration of
the Constitution, as it had been of the revolution. That inspiration
came from these truths, and they were declared to be self-evident,
“that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.” No trace of any
single one of these truths is to be found in the Constitution as then
adopted; nor in any of the Amendments that have since been
added, save in Sec. I., Art. XIV., which the self-constituted
citizens have rendered nugatory.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUR COPYING OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Our constitution and laws have nothing specifically American
about them. They are copies from the English, modified in some
particulars, which have been the inducement “to gather the spoils
while we may.” The President is an English king under another
name, selected by the “caucus,” the worst element in politics, and
elected by the people, because, under the vicious methods that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in vogue they have no way to vote save for one of the two at whom
ten thousand papers vie with each other in throwing mud during
the campaign. Many who have come to know how Presidents are
made have abandoned the polls in disgust. The Senate is a badly
abridged edition of the House of Lords, while the House of
Representatives is the same of the House of Commons. In the law
of primogeniture only do our laws differ materially from those of
England, this good feature having been borrowed from another
source. Nor have we any political literature save the Declaration
of Independence which has a distinct national character about it
that is purely American, and it is this that we celebrate year
after year; it is this and this only that calls out the patriotism of
the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>As far as the Constitution is concerned it is Dead Sea fruit. It
is an old and musty English sermon to which we have prefixed a
new and vital text, the text and sermon having no common ground
or meaning. The condition of the people and the country could
scarcely have been worse had we had Kings and Parliaments,
instead of Presidents and Congresses. A tree, let it be called by
whatever name, is known by the fruit it bears. If we are to judge
the political tree in this country in this way, shall we not be forced
to say that we have gathered thorns from grapes and thistles from
figs? In purity in the administration of justice, our Government
can stand no comparison with that of England. Money here is
king, and judge and jury also. Then must there not be something
radically wrong somewhere, and what can this be, except the
engrafting of a new political idea into an old political system?
This is what is the matter, and cringe as we may, there can never
be a change greatly for the better until the institutions of the
country are remodelled by the inspiration of that which led to
their establishment.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUR LACK OF GREAT STATESMEN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Had there been any really great men among our statesmen they
would have discovered the cause of the alternate “ups and downs”
in the prosperity of the country, and, at least, have attempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>some remedy. But we may look in vain through the whole list of
those who have, one after another, prominently occupied public
attention, for a great mind in the sense of instituting reforms in
government; in replacing vicious by beneficent legislation. Washington,
who will always be deservedly revered, was in no sense a
great man save in goodness. As a general or statesman he has been
excelled by dozens since his time, not one of whom has left anything
behind him that will make his name immortal. To be immortal in
history requires that there shall be some basis for it living in the
Government, or in the industrial habits of the people, or in their
religious faiths or rites. Buddha in India, Confucius in China,
Zoroaster in Persia, Mahomet among Mahomedans, and Jesus
amongst Christians, have immortality. But the religious element,
<i>per se</i>, never would have civilized the world. Indeed the nations most
under the influence of religious sentiments have done the least to
spread civilization into unknown countries. It is the warlike and
intellectual, in contradistinction to the religious and æsthetic,
nations to whom we owe the almost world-wide enlightenment of the
present, while the latter have remained shut up within themselves,
and are nothing but what their religion makes them. The contrast
between Egypt and India or China is, in this respect, most striking.
Egypt, becoming great at home, pushed out into the surrounding
world. With its immense armies under Sesostris and its no less
potent power emanating from the wise men who made the Alexandrian
library a possibility, it left its impress so fixed upon the world
that, even to this day, there are many things in the habits and
customs of the nations, especially in their literature and philosophies,
that are Egyptian. It was an Egyptian colony which laid the
foundation in Greece at Athens for the splendid civilization that
was there developed; for the glory, the military renown and the
arts and sciences that afterwards made Greece at once the admiration
and wonder of the world.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GREAT MINDS THE FOUNTAIN OF ALL GOOD.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The Egyptians were also a maritime people who made voyages
for discovery. It was under the instructions of one of its kings—Nechos—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>some skilful Phœnician sailors first sailed round the
coast of Africa. Six hundred years B.C. an attempt was also made
to do what the French engineer Lesseps has since done—to cut a
canal across the Isthmus of Suez. I mention these facts to show
how all the really great things that have done the world most
good have had their origin in some one great mind, who still lives
in the immortality of his creations, having impressed himself
inexpungibly upon the descent of the race and on civilization;
and by this showing to call attention to the further fact that the
number of the great who live in the present is extremely small,
and finally to show that this country has not produced even one
such mind outside the purely intellectual plane. The names of
Fulton and Field will live until steam, as a motor power, shall be
superseded by some more potent agent, and until the telegraphic
wires shall be no longer required to transmit the thoughts of one
to another at the antipodes of the earth; but in government the
list is blank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our basis must, however, be made still broader. Greece was
founded upon principles brought from Egypt; but in that small
country a new era was born. Egyptian achievements were the
culmination of an era of civilization of which Greece was fruit,
and became the seed for the next. Not only did Greece dim the
splendour of Egyptian warfare, but she also surpassed her in
intellectual attainment. The names of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle,
Archimedes, Xenophon, will live in philosophy as long as there is
a literature; while Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, Platea and
Mycale will stand for ever unapproachable in military and naval
glory, conclusive evidence of the power of order and organization
over mere numbers and brute force.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE POWER OF ELOQUENCE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>There was, however, another power behind this one of order
which made it invulnerable, irresistible. Philip of Macedon, the
father of Alexander the Great, testified of this power in these
words: “The eloquence of Demosthenes did me more harm than
all the armies and fleets of the Athenians. His harangues are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>like machines of war, and batteries raised at a long distance, by
which all my projects and enterprises are ruined. Had I been
present and heard that vehement orator declaim, I should have
been the first to conclude that it was necessary to declare war
against me. Nor could I reach him with gold, for in this respect,
by which I had gained so many cities, I found him invulnerable.”
Antipater also said of the same power: “I value not the galleys
nor armies of the Athenians. Demosthenes alone I fear. Without
him the Athenians are no better than the meanest Greeks. It is
he who rouses them from their lethargy and puts arms into their
hands almost against their wills. Incessantly representing the
battles of Marathon and Salamis, he transforms them into new
men. Nothing escapes his penetrating eye, nor his consummate
prudence. He foresees all our designs; he countermines all our
projects and disconcerts us in everything. Did the Athenians
confide in him and follow his advice we should be irredeemably
undone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>’Tis true that this was in the days of the declining Grecian
glory; but it is none the less true that it was the same power in
others previously that lifted a whole people to sublime achievements
and into grand and noble character. It was here, also, that
patriotism had birth; here that men devoted their lives to their
country for the country’s sake rather than for private gain or
glory. In this respect the character of Grecian generals and
statesmen has never been approached by any other nation. It
was this character that gave the Greeks as a nation, and to the
world as an example, the first code of laws; gave a Constitution
as a conservatory of the people’s rights, and made a Lycurgus
possible, the principles of whose Spartan code are only now beginning
to be appreciated. It is to this code that we must look as
the prime source of political economy, and it has been the inspiration
of all the modifications of laws ever made in the interests of
the people. In this respect, Lycurgus will be known in the
future ages as the Spartan law-giver of the world.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>LESSONS FROM ROMAN HISTORY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Roman history is a second edition of Grecian, enlarged in its
sphere of operations, and in its influence over the world. Rome,
however, would never have been possible, had Greece not first
been a fact. But Rome was vitiated in the character of her
public men, as compared with those of Greece, in about the same
ratio that she was greater in other respects. Greece was the admiration
of the world, but Rome was its astonishment. All that
she was, sank with her as she went down into the dark ages. The
best of what made Greece, still lives in the people of the world.
Greece was the garden of modern civilization and will remain its
inspiration until three elements of character—the religious, the intellectual
and the social—shall join their powers to construct the
future government of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charlemagne was the basis of the first great national character
that evolved after the dark ages, and Otho the Great laid the
foundation for the present dominance of Bismarck and Von Moltke
in Central Europe. Cromwell, more than any other, is the inspiration
of English character, modified by its respect for the political
rights of women by the influence of Queen Elizabeth, under whom
England reached the acme of its power and glory. But in French
history is to be found the most distinct evidence of a communication
to a whole people of the character of a single individual that
there is to be found anywhere. The French character, both as a
nation and as an individual, may be summed up in one word—Bonaparte.
With the advent of this giant mind came a crisis over
all modern Europe. Under his influence not only did the national
character of the French people change, but the individual
character also underwent many modifications. Nor was this confined
to France, for this man’s genius was felt in every capital in
the world. He conquered the nations and compelled them to
change their laws, while to France he gave an entire new code, to
which, more than to anything else, France owes her position among
nations. It was the result of these laws that gave to France the
capacity to rise from the disaster inflicted upon her by Prussia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Her immense loans came in small sums from the peasantry, and
when paid will remain in France, which will not suffer the double
impoverishment that most nations suffer from a public debt. The
possibility of this was due to the far-reaching statesmanship of
Napoleon Bonaparte, when he changed the laws regarding the
inheritance of property, taking the estate from the deceased and
dividing it equally among all the children—the greatest innovation
that had ever been made upon the old feudal system, and together
with other reforms, fixing France in a position to become more
prosperous internally than any other European nation. Bonaparte
also broke down the barriers that divided the nations and races of
Europe, and opened up the way for closer commercial and literary
relations, and performed, during the twenty years that he was in
France, a greater service for the advancement of civilization than
was ever performed by any other person who ever lived. In a
sense, and in a good sense, too, it may be said that he dictated to
the world, because the changes that he instituted and compelled
have produced a modifying influence over the whole world. Taken
as a whole, Bonaparte was the greatest man who ever lived.
Certainly he equalled the greatest generals, and his campaigns,
with those of Hannibal and Scipio-Africanus, will be the textbooks
for military students as long as the art of war remains a
study; while as a statesman he stands at the head of the greatest.
He was Lycurgus, Alexander, Hannibal, Talleyrand, Bismarck
combined. He represented, if he did not excel, the greatest of all
ages, save Confucius and Jesus, save Demosthenes and Cicero.
He never taught morality, <i>per se</i>, but he believed that a well-governed
and industrially-thrifty people would necessarily be also
moral, and he never made a speech except to point out the enemy
to his soldiers. The treachery of a single man—Grouchy—who
permitted Blucher to hurl the Prussian army unopposed upon his
wearied troops after they had defeated Wellington at Waterloo,
changed the whole future destiny of Europe, and prevented
Bonaparte from becoming the beneficent law-giver of the world as
he had been of France. For behind all his ambition in which only
he is known to the world, and, therefore, not known at all, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>an unalterably fixed purpose to raise the common people of Europe
to their proper position; but this he could do only by first
conquering the rulers who stood in his way.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>LYCURGUS AND BONAPARTE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is, therefore, to Lycurgus and to Bonaparte, more than to
any others, to whom we must look as the master-minds in government;
as those who instituted sweeping changes in the political
institutions of the world, and in this sense they are the greatest of
all the great who live in profane history. Many slight reforms
have been effected; but they alone conceived and reduced to a
system the changes that revolutionized and replaced the old
beneficently to the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bonaparte himself recognized that his greatness consisted in
this, for, when he asked his friends to which of his achievements
he would owe his life in history, and they replied, naming some
campaign or battle, he corrected them and said; “I shall go down
in history with my <cite>Code Napoleon</cite> in my hands.” So it was not
Marengo, not Wagram, not Austerlitz, not Dresden, not any nor
all his great victories to which he looked as his best achievement;
but it was the code of laws by which he made France the happiest
country in Europe. It is not to be wondered at that his name
lives in the hearts of the French and moves them as no other
name ever moved a people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great as Bismarck may be, he is not great in the true sense of
greatness, for he is building up a power that the next fifty years
will have to overthrow. True greatness works in the direction of
and not against progress, and its works live. Compared with him,
Disraeli may after all, should his intentions toward India have a
humanitarian tendency, turn out to be the greater man.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this view of greatness, to whom shall we look among our
statesmen for any of its evidences? Beyond the legislation that
the abolition of slavery forced upon us, the homestead act and one
recently introduced by Gen. Banks, enlarging its scope in the
interests of the settler, and some concessions to the people, like the
eight hour law, we may search the legislation of the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>through in vain for any evidence of humanitarian tendencies in
our legislators. On the contrary, the inspiration of the privileged
classes, the power and use of wealth will be found everywhere;
’tis true that we have a Republican Government in name and
form, but it is also true that money rules, that it elects the officers
and controls the legislation. The people who are outside of the
privileged classes, outside of the offices and the press, are powerless
to help themselves. The machinery of the government is in the
hands of those who want things to continue as they are, while the
few in power who are devoted to the public welfare, beat the air in
vain attempts to strike either the causes of, or the remedy for
existing evils.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>NEED OF A NEW CODE OF LAWS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>But they may be summed up in a few words. The causes lie in
the fruitless attempt to run a Republican Government upon an
aristocratic code of laws, and the remedy is to remodel the code by
the principles of the declaration, which should be made the
inspiration of every provision, as well as the key to its construction.
I might enumerate the special evils that have grown out of the
error made in the Constitution—the vicious legislation for which
this error laid the foundation—that the rule of the majority is not
a Republican idea; that “the majority” is another name for the
despot; that minorities are entitled to, and can be represented; I
might show that the United States is, after all, nothing but a confederation
of equal and antagonistic powers, and not a Federal
Union; that Washington is more a place in which representatives
from the several States assemble to quarrel over the spoils of office
and to lay the ropes for the succession, than it is the capital of a
free and mighty people; that there is such a contrariety of laws in
the several States upon any given subject, that it puzzles a Philadelphia
lawyer to tell whether a given act is a crime, a misdemeanour,
or whether actionable at all in the different States; if people
be married in one State, whether they are so legally in any other,
or if divorced the same. I might show that taxation is unequal
and oppressive, and the revenue unjust; and if there were need of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>it, which there is not, that official patronage is a polite name for
public plunder, and that the public service is a vast system of
organized corruption. Had the original error not been made, had
the fountain been kept pure, none of these baneful things could
have been engrafted into the system. But they have now
obtained a root so deep that they can never be exterminated save
by uprooting the system. They are the Canada thistles in the
fertile meadow, that spread themselves until they absorb the whole
vitality of the soil and thrust out the useful harvest. These thistles
have spread and seeded in the government until they have thrust
out every honest servant of the people, and until one who has any
care for his reputation cannot afford to meddle with the government.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MUST WE HAVE A REVOLUTION?</h3>

<p class='c008'>How can such a state of things be remedied save by a revolution?
The people may listen to the “outs” who pretend to tell
them that it may; but should they come to the “ins” they would
follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. The machine is
running down hill too fast to be now stopped; the tide of power
has set too strongly toward corruption to be reversed; the political
body is too thoroughly impregnated with the poison to make its
purging possible by any change of medicine. The disease is incurable
because it is in the system more than in the individual men
who run it. It has had its youth, its manhood, and is now in its
old and decaying age. No power can save it; and those who think
they can, who think that they can patch it up with tonics for a
time, are only preparing for a worse ruin when the crash shall
come.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the people would not care so much about the government;
they would be willing to let the politicians run it as they please,
and enjoy its spoils as they have for a century; they would even
endure, as they have, uncomplainingly, any extortion that their
earnings would permit without reducing them to the starvation
point; but when in addition to the absorption of all their earnings
to pay the debts of official extravagance and vicious legislation it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>threatened to foreclose the mortgages on the industries and sell
them out, and thus take away their means of livelihood, they have
a right, indeed it is their duty, to object, and they are beginning
to do it in real earnest.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A WORD TO NON-PRODUCERS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>I do not say this in the interest of the workmen, but speak in
appeal to the non-productive classes, those who live without
labour, to show them that through their servants, the Congress
and the administrators of the laws, they are repeating the
folly of the Southern slave-holders, who could not have found a
more effectual way to rid themselves of slavery than that which
they adopted. Looking upon it now, it seems that they could not
have been satisfied with the progress of abolitionism in the North,
under the lead of Garrison, Phillips and Douglass, and therefore
they stirred up the war at home to precipitate the end, and succeeded
admirably. The heartiness with which the Southern
members of the St. Louis Convention recently accepted “the results”
is evidence that this is a proper view to take of it. It is
only a wonder that, going so far as they did, they did not fall into
the arms of the Cincinnati Convention and thank its party
for the services rendered them. But this aside. Had they been
content to keep the power they had, they might have retained
their slaves for years to come; but they wanted more! more!
more! Nothing less than the whole country as slave territory
would satisfy their morbidness upon the subject. Perhaps they
did not know what they were doing; but they must have been blind
indeed if there were not among them one sagacious mind who
understood it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when, through promises from northern doughfaces, they had
brought on the war, then those who had been gradually getting
rich, quietly extending their mortgages, through railroad and other
speculative schemes and exorbitant rates of interest, saw an opportunity
to extend, at a single effort, their grasp over the whole
property of the country, and reduce the masses to servitude for all
time to come, as they are reduced in England. The classes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>whom I speak knew that the government would have to have
money; and that it would have to come to them to get
it; and they also knew that the longer the war continued
the more money would be required. So, while the copper-headed
bankers of the North gave the rebels all the encouragement
they dared, their English brethren furnished them with arms and
ammunition, and thus the war was prolonged and made a costly
one. The plan was well conceived and nicely executed; the productive
classes were saddled with a debt of $3,000,000,000, for
which the government received little more than half that sum.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SOME TELLING FIGURES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>But they who were engaged in this scheme over-reached themselves
as the South had done before them. They over-estimated
the vitality and endurance of the industries, already carrying a
debt of $4,000,000,000 in railroad, State, county and municipal
bonds, besides paying interest on individual loans to a still larger
amount. They could not bear the added burden. With gold at
par with which the interest was paid on this enormous debt before
the war, they managed to get along; but when the war had raised
the price of gold and had added $3,000,000,000 to the debt, it was
more than they could stand. On this $11,000,000,000 debt, with
the interest on some parts of it at 8, 9, 10 and even 12 and 15 per
cent. per annum, and allowing for the large discounts that were
frequently extorted, and adding to this the premiums paid for gold
and including the dividends on stocks, the industries of the
country were, and still are, taxed $1,300,000,000 every year
to pay interest! Think of it, you who take this interest!
Think of the toiling millions who, beneath the broiling sun, or in
the murky mines, or dismal shops, or in the frozen forests, give up
their lives to toil! Think of it! Taxed $1,300,000,000 annually
for interest, part of which goes to enrich European bankers, and
the remainder to those who, in luxurious ease, idle their lives
away at home. Think of it, I repeat again, and then wonder, if
you can, that industry is prostrate beneath the heel of capital!
Say, if you can, whether the wonder is not rather, that there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>wheel in motion in the country, or that there is a plough moving in
the soil.</p>

<p class='c009'>The total products amount to but $5,000,000,000 annually.
Out of this, there is first to come the subsistence of the 44,000,000
population. On an average it cannot be said that it costs less than
$100 a year per capita to support this mass. Some people spend
more than that for cigars in a single month, and others double for
wines and other liquors, to say nothing about establishments costing
thousands upon thousands to maintain; and yet there are so many
who live upon less than $100 a year, that the average cost of
subsistence may be placed at that sum. This would consume
$4,400,000,000 of the $5,000,000,000 products, and leave but
$600,000,000 with which to pay the $1,300,000,000 interest.
Hence it is plainly to be seen that the productive interests of the
country are running into debt to the capitalists at the rate of
$700,000,000 every year; that their mortgages on the property of
the country are increasing yearly by that amount. This is a
frightful showing, but it is a true one; it is one that the labouring
classes are beginning to understand; it is one that you who are
oppressing them should also understand, for, by ignoring it, you
are challenging swift destruction. The only question is, how long
can these things go on, with the wealth of the country increasing
at the rate of two and a half per cent. per annum; it is a simple
thing to calculate how long it will require for money, increasing at
the rate of 6, 8, 10, and even 15 and 20 per cent. per annum, to
consume the wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ROOT OF THE TROUBLE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>We come now in logical order to the grand and fundamental error
that has been made which lies at the back of all political fallacies,
and to which are to be primarily attributed all industrial and
financial ills from which we suffer, both as a nation and as
individuals, since, let the Government be as good as it may, with
this error lying between it and the industries, it were impossible
that evil should not come upon the people. Hence, let the
Government and the public service be as bad as they may; let the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>people suffer from bad legislation as much as they have; the fault
is, after all, more to be charged against the system than against
the individuals who, for the time, are its administrators. No
matter how skilful the engineer may be, nor how watchful the
fireman; if the engine itself be faulty in construction, it will explode;
or if the engine be perfect in itself, but connected with
other machinery that is not fitted to run at the same speed as the
engine, then the machinery will fly in pieces. The same is true of
the relations between the Government—the political organisations
of the people—and the wealth producers—the industrial organisation
of the people, as we shall see, for the Government is a machine
constructed after the highest known principles of political mechanism,
while intimately connected with it is the industrial
organisation, running upon the very lowest—the rudimental—industrial
mechanism. Consequently, when the political machinery
runs at a high rate of speed, requiring an extra amount of fuel and
water, the industrial machinery, in its efforts to supply this demand,
and urged on by its connection to keep pace with the rapid
motion, flies in pieces; becomes prostrated and useless, as we see
it everywhere in the country now, when to keep the political
machinery running at the present high rate of speed, it has to
draw upon its accumulated stock of fuel, as it is doing now to the
amount of $700,000,000 annually.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we go back and examine the evolution of government and
industry, all this will be made clear; so clear that all may understand
it. Certain fixed laws direct and regulate the growth of
everything, and they are the same for all departments in the
universe. The statement of the laws by which the sidereal and
solar systems have evolved, will also describe those which the
earth has obeyed, and are the laws of all material, governmental,
industrial, intellectual, social, moral and religious change. This
law as applied to government and industry may be stated in
philosophic terms, thus: The progress of government and industry
is a continuous establishment of physical relations within the community,
in conformity with physical relations arising within the environment,
during which the government, industry and the environment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>pass from a state of incoherent homogeneity to a state of coherent
heterogeneity; and, during which, the constitutional units of
the government and industry become ever more distinctly
individualized.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we examine the growth of industry and government, and the
relations that exist between them now, in this country, we shall
discover how far they have advanced from incoherent homogeneity
toward coherent heterogeneity. Looking through the dim vistas of
the past into the pre-historic time, we find a time when there were
no aggregations of individuals larger than the family; that the
family was the only government and the only organization for
industry; that its head ruled with arbitrary sway, having no one
to whom he was accountable, each family having to depend wholly
upon itself for subsistence. The people then were in the same state
politically and industrially, and this was the homogeneous or
original state. Afterwards we find that, for protection or for conquest,
two or more families combined in a political sense and
formed tribes, having an absolute head, but remaining in the
rudimentary state industrially; next, tribes came together and
built cities, and cities then coalesced and constituted nations (the
rulers of which still using arbitrary power), until single rulers
aspired to the dominion of the world; and in a sense succeeded.
But all this time, industrially, the people remained in the original
state. There had been no coalescing for the purpose of subsistence
as there had been for government. While politically the people
had evolved through several stages of progression, industrially
they were still in the rudimentary state.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having arrived at the culmination of growth in the line of
absolute power, one man having controlled the destinies of the
world (thus typifying the future yet to be when the world shall be
united under a humanitarian, in place of a despotic government;
under the rule of all instead of that of one), a new departure was
set up in the direction of this future condition, and the power to
which one man aspired began to redistribute itself in limited and
constitutional monarchies, down through kings and queens,
nobility and republics, to the people generally, in this country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>advancing so far as to be divided practically among nearly one-half
of the people, and theoretically among the whole. Evolution on
this line will go on till every person in the world shall form a part
of the government. Then the great human family will be a
possibility.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>But up to the present time, what have the people done industrially?
Almost nothing, save to subsist themselves on the rudimental
plane! Nothing, save to make a few experiments at
coalescing. There are a few illustrations of the first step in
progress in this respect, which correspond to the coming together
of families politically. But there are no industrial cities, to say
nothing about nations. There were Brook Farm, New Harmony, and
several other attempts at industrial tribes, and there are Oneida
and a dozen lesser attempts still in existence, besides numerous cooperative
movements. There are the railroad, the telegraph,
insurance companies, banks and other corporations, all evidences
that a real departure is about to be made in industrial organization;
that is, that the people are preparing to depart from the homogeneous
state industrially. The grange movement is the most
positive evidence of the moving of the people generally in this
direction, in which to protect themselves against the rapacity of
merchants and railroads, they combine to purchase from first
hands and realize a saving of from twenty to fifty per cent. This
is an illustration of coalescing for protection. Most of the other
illustrations, such as railroads, banks, etc., are for aggressive
purposes; are means by which the people, while being seemingly
accommodated, are really being robbed. Nevertheless, they are
all evidences of progress in the industrial sense, those for aggression
in the end compelling others for protection. That there are
so many forms of coalescings for aggressive purposes, is conclusive
evidence that the time is near when the people will be driven into
organizing themselves into industrial communities, cities and
nations, and eventually into one nation for the whole world. The
first departure having been made, nothing can prevent industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>from passing through the same stages of progress through which
government has passed, and eventually becoming “at one” with
government.</p>

<p class='c009'>Has the evolution of government proved a blessing to the
people? Are we, as a people, in a better condition politically?
Are we nearer the ultimate condition than they were of
ancient time, when the family was the highest form of government?
If we are, then we should be equally improved, industrially, if we
were upon the same plane in this respect. There are no contradictions
in natural growth. Like degrees of evolution bring equal
good in all; the same to government, to industry, to intellect, to
morals, to religion. But this development does not mean for the
rich what it is inferred by them to mean, unless, indeed, they
attempt to resist its progress, which if they do, the same fate will
overtake them that came upon those who attempted to stay the
tide of political growth. It means for them just what the development
of government meant for those who held and exercised its
power. The political relations of the monarch and nobility
are repeated in the industrial relations of the capitalists
and working men. The “levelling” politically has not been
down but up. Instead of the rulers having been degraded
into serfdom, the serfs have been elevated to the plane
of rulers in this country. In the place of one man ruling
over others, all men rule themselves, at least in theory.
In this transformation no one has been deprived of anything that
of right belonged to him; but the masses have received their
natural rights from those who held them from them by the right
of might. When the industries shall rise to the stage of growth
which the government occupies, a like “levelling up” will take
place; a like relinquishment of industrial power will be made
in favour of the toiling masses. None who are independent now
will be made dependent then; but the dependent will rise to independence.
Hence the alarm of the rich is wholly without foundation.
Such a move does not mean the slightest harm for them;
it means equal good for all. It does not mean the taking away
of any comfort or luxury from anybody; but the extension of every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>comfort and luxury that any have to all—to those who suffer, be
it from hunger, from nakedness, from want of shelter, or
other cause.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUR NATIONAL DEBT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If this analysis be applied to the present situation we shall see
what is the matter with the industries. When the South rebelled,
the North was compelled to resist, or else permit the national
unity to be destroyed. Let it be borne in mind what stress was
put upon the necessity of preserving the oneness of the people
politically. To do this an army was required. When volunteers
ceased to offer in sufficient numbers to keep the army to its necessary
strength, the government, acting upon the right of a representative
of a politically united people, resorted to drafting to
determine which of the members of this unity should go into the
army and jeopardize their lives for its preservation. This was in
perfect harmony with the principles of government upon which
this order rests, and was fully endorsed by the people. But what
did the government do to subsist these men, and to provide the
munitions of war? Did it proceed the same way that it did to
secure the men? Not at all! It borrowed the money from the
bankers of New York, Hamburg and London, and agreed to pay
them a rate of interest double that demanded of any other first
class nation, parting with its bonds to them at “60.” In other
words, it borrowed $1,800,000,000, at 10 per cent., and gave
$1,200,000,000 in bonds as bonus for making the loan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this was the error that was committed, for, although the
people were industrially upon a lower order of development than
they were politically, nevertheless, since necessity knows no law save
that of its own conditions, the government should have proceeded
as if we were upon the same plane in both respects. When
it called for volunteers to raise an army, and the ranks of industry
responded liberally, it should at the same time have also called for
volunteer assistance from the ranks of wealth, to subsist that
army; and as it resorted to drafting to maintain the necessary
number of fighting men when volunteering failed to do it, so should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it have resorted to drafting the means with which to pay their expenses
when volunteer assistance should have failed to do it. Had
the people been one industrially as they were politically; had the
industrial organization of the people been upon the same plane
as their political organization, this would have been done
naturally, and there would have been no bonded debt incurred.</p>

<p class='c009'>What does this show? This clearly; that, while the government
can command the lives of the working men and put them in
jeopardy, even sacrifice them without stint to maintain itself, it
has no power over the property of the rich to compel them to
assist in that maintenance. Had it been so that the government
could not have borrowed any money, it would have fallen from
this disparity between the political and industrial development.
Is not this clear? And if it is, does it not show a very great and
grave defect in the wisdom of our institutions?</p>

<p class='c009'>But what has been the effect of this error in this instance? The
present prostration of industry, necessarily: and it has come
about in this way: The armies were made up from the ranks of
industry; the “rank and file” were so many men taken away from
producing, and, therefore, from adding to the accumulated wealth;
but the maintenance of the army was borrowed at an exorbitant rate
of interest from the accumulated wealth, which was wholly
in the hands of those who never fired a shot in defence of the
country, nor added a dollar to its aggregate wealth by labour.
While the war continued, the men who were left in the ranks of
industry were called upon to pay this interest; and when it was
over, those who had survived the war and returned to productive
toil were included with them. And it is expected that the industrial
classes will continue to pay this interest until the bonds
mature, and then the bonds themselves, as I shall show you that
they do hereafter; or what is more to the point, for the
$1,800,000,000 that the government borrowed from the money-lenders
it would compel the people to return them as bonus,
interest and principal, the enormous sum of $5,000,000,000.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>INDUSTRY OVER-BURDENED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hence by this error, made possible by the false relations of
government and industry, the government has not only compelled
industry to furnish the men to fight its battles, win its victories,
and maintain its integrity, but it also compels it to pay all the
expenses of the war, besides to continue adding to the wealth of
the rich. The gentlemen in whose interests it was principally
fought, who have sat quietly at home in luxury, and drawn the
life-blood from the poor, now go out of all the effects of the war
with their fortunes trebled by having merely loaned the government
the money it needed to maintain itself in the struggle.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a true picture, moderately drawn, of the real facts.
While I do not desire to stir up the wrongs that industry has
suffered in this matter, and drive the weary toilers to seek redress,
it is nevertheless time, when thousands of families are suffering the
pangs of hunger as a consequence of this wrong, to lay it open
before the people who have been its cause and who have profited
by it; it is time that the government should be shown the errors
that it has committed and be told that the people are coming to an
understanding of them; time that the bond-holders should know
that the people are aware of the tenure by which they hold these
mortgages on the industries. Let the one protest as it may and
the other plead innocence under the revelations as they will, I
intend to do everything in my power to rouse them to a sense of
the danger in which they stand from the still sleeping masses, who,
when they shall come to a full realization of the impositions that
have been practised upon them, will not hesitate at any means of
redress; especially will they not hesitate when the modern Shylocks,
having relentlessly demanded not only the last “pound of
flesh” but their very life’s blood also, demand likewise the payment
of the bonds! The people already begin to learn that the government
has no sympathy for their sufferings, and that it declares
that it has no power to alleviate them, which they will think is
strange enough since it had the power to bring these evils upon
them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>WHAT LABOUR WILL SAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Under these conditions they will soon come to argue like this:—Was
it not enough to demand of industry that it should fight the
battles for the government? Was it not enough that the working-classes
should lay down their lives by thousands upon a hundred
fields of battle? Was it not enough that mothers and wives should
give their sons and husbands to fill the soldier’s grave that the
wealth of the country might remain inviolate? Was it not enough
that we did all this without now being forced to give our toil year
after year to return these rich, who did nothing, these loans? Is
it too much to ask of wealth that it pay the expenses of the
war? Should we not rather demand, in tones of thunder if
lesser ones are insufficient to rouse its holders to a sense of
their duty, that it shall bear its part of the burden? We have
looked on quietly and seen the sufferings to which this people
are reduced by the rapacity of the usurers, until we can no longer
hold our peace; and if it be in our power, we intend that wealth
and not industry shall yet be made to pay what it should have been
made to pay at first; that it shall return to the government the
bonds which the toiling masses have redeemed by the rivers of
blood that they have shed, and that the government shall return the
$2,000,000,000 of interest that it has already filched from industry
for interest on this most unjust debt. In other words, since we
gave the lives that it was necessary to sacrifice to conquer the
rebellion from our ranks, we intend that the rich shall give from
what they had when the rebellion broke out, to pay all the expenses
of the war, and we will never rest until this be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>These, I say, are the arguments to which the suffering labourers
will resort if you permit them to is driven to desperation by hunger
from want of employment. If the rich were wise, they would forestall
all opportunity for such arguments to be used, by coming
forward voluntarily to do them justice. If what I have suggested
will be their arguments, is true, as you know that it is, then
wealth should pay the expenses of the war without any further
delay, because it is a gross injustice, not to say an unwarrantable
imposition on good nature, to make the men who did the fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>also pay this debt, while those for whom it was mostly fought have
done nothing but to speculate out of it. Perhaps you have never
looked at it in this light; but if you have not, then I pray you look
at it so now, before your attention shall be called to it in an
unpleasant way; for, unless relief come soon to those who are
suffering the pangs of hunger, by reason of your blindness, there
will be an imperious demand made of you.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE SILVER QUESTION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>As if they were not yet satisfied with the oppressions already in
operation, some of those whom you have sent to Washington to
conduct your business, and who have got you into all this difficulty,
think that silver is not good enough money in which to pay interest,
because it is not now worth proportionally quite so much as gold.
Where has the wisdom and prudence of this people fled? Have they
no care for what <i>may</i> come upon their families, that they sit by and see
indignity after indignity piled mountain-high upon the people?
The lives, the labour, the all of the poor may be taken for the
public good; but your bonds, your money, your usury must not be
touched. They are considered to be of more consequence than life
and toil and everything else that the poor have got to be taken!—your
revenue must be sacred, and the Shylocks must take their
“pound of flesh” from the daily labourer, let it cost whatever blood it
may in the cutting of it; and no wise Portia comes to stay the hand
already dripping with the life of the toilers, for is not the interest
wrenched from their toil, their life! Look at the poor of the
country; millions of them without work and their families either
starving or else on the verge of starvation. Let me read you extracts
from two articles from the <cite>New York Sun</cite> of the 20th of July, so that
you may see that I am not overdrawing the picture: “Starvation in
New York. The sufferings among the poor are fearful. The
sufferers are chiefly widows and young children, who, for lack of
nourishment, are unable to withstand the intense heat. Instances
of actual starvation are mentioned. A widow and her young
daughter and son, who are unable to find work, had been for some
time living on $2 a week. In a garret, without any other furniture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>than an old dry goods box for a table and a broken chair, live a
widow and her five young children. In a closet are a mattress and
a blanket, which at night make a bed for the whole family. An
aged woman, who was once in affluent circumstances, was some
time ago found nearly dead with hunger; it was only by careful
nursing that she was saved. A young man, whose family were
gradually starving, was driven to despair and intent on suicide.
The child of another died, and not only was the father unable to
bury it, but he was unable to provide food for the living.” These
are only a few of the cases that come under the observation of a
single church relief society. What shall we say of the great city?
The other was entitled “Widespread Destitution in Brooklyn. At
the meeting of the King’s County Charity Commissioners yesterday,
Mr. Bogan said that there was almost as much destitution in the
city now as at midwinter. The families of unemployed men who
up to this time have never asked for a cent of charity, were daily
besieging his office. The system of outdoor relief had been abandoned,
and there was no way to provide for the needy except out
of his private purse. The heads of families were forced into idleness
by the hard times, and, having exhausted all their means
were face to face with starvation.” Is not this a fearful picture of
those who have helped to make the wealth with which the storehouses
of the country are loaded? African slavery was a blessing
compared with the condition of thousands of the poor. Let its
evils have been as great as we know that they were, the negroes
never suffered for food; the women and children never died of
starvation; never suffered from cold or went naked. Oh, that
some master mind, some master spirit, might be sent of God to
show you the way out of this desolation and the necessity of
deliverance. But I fear you will not be wise enough to avoid the
penalty for neglecting to keep your industrial institutions on the
same plane with your political organization, which is the only
possible remedy for the present evils. The people must be made
as much one industrially as they are politically. Then there would
be harmony and consequent peace and prosperity.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>IS CASTE A NECESSITY?</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But to this the common objection is raised, that it is impossible
to make industrial interests common, on account of the necessary
differences in labour: that there must be caste in industry. This
was the reply that the king made to the people who wanted a
political republic; of course it will be the reply that the privileged
classes will make to those who want an industrial republic. You
know how fallacious the objection has been politically. The king
deprived of his crown has not been compelled to sleep with the
scavenger. It will prove equally as fallacious industrially. The
money and railroad kings will not have to live with the men who
do the rough work of the industrial public, unless they choose to
do so, any more than they do now. The foundation stones of a
house always remain at the bottom, covered up in the dirt; nevertheless,
they are even more important to the safety of the house
than any upper part. So it will be in the industrial structure
when it shall be erected. There will always be Vanderbilts,
Stewarts, Fields and Fultons—the agents of the people industrially,
as there are now presidents, governors and mayors—agents of the
people politically. And do you not see how perfectly this corresponds
to the teachings of Jesus when He said: “Let him who
would be greatest among you be the servant of all,” and with this
falls the objection of the aristocrat to the industrial republic, as
utterly untenable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The real inspiration of this objection, however, springs from
quite another source. Those who make it know that with the
coming of industrial organisation, the power which money has
to increase will fall, and make it impossible for anybody to live
without labour. Money has no rightful power to increase. Its
origin and sphere distinctly forbid the power, as can be clearly
shown. The theory that money is wealth is false. It came to
be accepted from the fact that valuable things have been used as
money.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wealth is the product of labour; is anything that labour produces
or gathers. But the functions of money are representative
wholly. Money takes the place of wealth for the time—stands for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>it. Here is the fallacy of a specie basis for money: specie is
wealth, and can be made a basis for the issue of money, but the
error consists in making a distinction against other kinds of wealth
which would be equally as good. Anything that has value may
properly be made a basis for the issue of a currency.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we trace the origin of money, all this will be made plain. At
the basis of all questions relating to wealth and money, lie the
elements—the land, the water, the air—and these are the free gifts
of God to man. None have the right to dispossess others of their
natural inheritance in these elements. The right to life carries
along with it the right to the use of so much of each of these
elements as is necessary to support it. No one has a natural right
to more than this. Hence, men have no more right to seize upon
the land and deprive others of its use, or part with it to others for
a consideration, than they have to bottle the air for the same purpose.
There can be no ownership of the elements; no ownership of
the land any more than of the air or water. Pretended ownership
is another name for a usurpation. But the elements, unused, are
valueless. Labour applied to them yields results, and these are
valuable, consequently wealth; the net results after subsisting the
people are the accumulated wealth of the world, and there is no
other wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MONEY THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If every person were to produce all the different things he needs
or wants, there would be no use for money, and the people would
escape the curses that follow in its trail, but experience taught
labourers that it was an economy for each to labour in some
special way, and to exchange his surplus products for those of others
labouring in different ways. Besides, the different climates produce
different commodities, of each of which all other climates require a
share. Out of these facts came agencies for effecting exchanges—money,
the merchant and commerce. In their origin and normal
functions they are the agents, the servants of labour; but when
from exchanging the products of labour they grew into speculating
in these products, then they assumed abnormal functions, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>became the masters of labour. It must be seen, therefore, that
the only legitimate method by which wealth can increase, is by
adding to itself the net results of labour; indeed that is the only
way in which it can increase. It must also be clear that these results
belong <i>in toto</i> to their producers, since, if nothing were
exchanged save equivalents, these results could never pass from
the hands of their producers. But by permitting the representatives
of wealth—money—to have the power to increase, the makers
of money have been able to filch all the net earnings from labour,
and as a result of this, most of the accumulated wealth of the
world is in the hands of the makers of money instead of in those
of the makers of wealth. This may be legal, but can never be
made just. Had the labourers been let alone they would have
continued to produce and exchange their commodities among
themselves without any trouble, and they could have always maintained
themselves comfortably. But the “middlemen”—their
agents—conceived, constructed and thrust upon them a vicious
system of money, by which they are forced to pay tribute on everything
that passes from, or is received by them, which tribute
amounts to the total net products of all the industries.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE PRIVATE BANKING SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The system of private or corporate banking is an example in
point. Why do individuals want a gold basis upon which to issue
currency? To get the privilege to levy interest on many times as
much currency as they have capital invested. A bank with an
actual capital of $100,000 in gold could issue $300,000 in currency,
all which it could loan out together with nearly all the
deposits that it could secure, which, in some instances, have been
known to amount to ten times the capital. Why should not a class
of men, if the people are blind enough to let them do it, speculate
upon the credulity of the public through the idea that they are
rendering a public service? Why should they not desire to
“bank,” when by banking they can receive interest on $1,000,000,
when otherwise they could collect it upon $100,000 only? The
same idea is the inspiration of national banking, and of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>oppose a national currency. The banks bought, say $100,000 of
United States bonds from the Government for $60,000. These
bonds they deposited with the treasurer, and the people were required
to pay $6000 a year interest on them, while the banks
received from the Government $100,000 in national bank currency
with which they were set afloat. These notes were loaned to the
people, who again paid an interest on the same capital of $6000,
or 20 per cent. per annum—$12,000 on $60,000; and yet the bank
men have made the people think that they are offering them great
accommodations. “Oh,” says the National Bank legislator, “we
must get rid of these abominable, depreciated, irredeemable greenbacks,
and make room for more national banknotes.” Do you
know for what that legislation is bidding? He wants, if he has
not already got it,—from some national bank man in his district,
or else he has an interest in some bank. What is the security of
national bank notes? United States bonds deposited in the
Treasury. What is the security of the bonds? The public faith
of the United States. What is the security of the greenbacks?
The public faith of the United States. What difference in this respect,
then, is there between national bank notes and greenbacks?
None. Then as a currency there is this difference between the
bank notes and greenbacks: If greenbacks were to take the place
of the bank notes, the bank men would not get 20 per cent. interest
on their capital, and the privilege of receiving and loaning the
deposits of the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>But look at it in another light. Suppose the security of the
national bank notes were their own capital instead of the bonds,
who would not prefer to trust the faith of the United States, rather
than that of any individual in these times of Credit Mobilers,
Tweed and whiskey rings? Then, again, why should individuals
furnish the circulating medium of the people, when the people can
furnish it themselves and save the expense? $1,000,000,000 is as
small an amount of currency of all kinds as will transact the business
of the country properly. Why should not the $60,000,000,
which the people would have to pay the banks for interest on this,
be paid to the Government for greenbacks? And more! Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>should not all the interest that is now paid to individuals and
banks for private loans, be paid to the Government? It is estimated
that the average amount of private loans for the whole
country is not less than $5,000,000,000 upon which, at even 6 per
cent. interest, the people are taxed $300,000,000. Is there any valid
reason why the Government should not loan this money and receive
this interest? Yes, for if it did, the rich could not live in
luxurious idleness, while the poor are obliged to labour twice the
natural time to subsist the world.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHY DO THE PEOPLE PAY INTEREST?</h3>

<p class='c008'>Or still again: why should the people pay any interest at all on
loans from themselves? Why should not their agent—the Government—when
amply secured, freely loan the people all the money that
they want for use? Suppose that the farmers and the manufacturers
did not have to pay interest on the money that they are compelled
to have to produce their crops and goods? Don’t you see that
they could compete successfully with the people of any country in
the world, in the production of anything? Institute free money
and there would be no necessity for a tariff for protection to keep
out the cheaper goods of other nations. But on the contrary, this
country would shortly be supplying other nations with the very
things with which they are now supplying us and thereby crippling
our manufactures and productions. Besides, all the people would
be constantly employed, prices would be low, every comfort and
even luxury abundant and in the reach of all, and thrift would
replace stagnation everywhere. Plenty of money, plenty of work
and plenty of everything that the ingenuity and strength of man
can make, are the most favourable conditions for the masses; while
just the reverse is true for the privileged classes. But why, since
the former class outnumbers the latter, as five to one, do not the
former have all things their own way in this country where the
majority rule? Ask the masses this, and they can make no reply.
But it is because the superior intelligence and tact of the minority
enable them to concoct schemes by which, without seeming to do
so, they reduce the majority to actual, though mostly unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>servitude; making them pay, first, all the interest on the public
and private debts; next, all the expenses of the national, state,
county and municipal governments; and next, obtain their own
support and the increase of their wealth from them. Do you think
that I overstate this? I think I can make it so clear that you
cannot doubt it; and if I do, will you not think differently of the
toiling masses than you have thought of them heretofore? At the
beginning of any year take the amount of real wealth in the hands
of the non-producers. During the year the governments continue,
the taxes are gathered and the expenses are paid: your debts,
your expenses and all; the producers have continued to labour as
usual, and at the end of the year find themselves just where they
were at its beginning; but the property of the wealthy classes has
increased about three per cent. for the whole country. And while
the latter class has become fewer in numbers and richer individually,
the former has increased in numbers and become poorer individually.
Now these are the facts, and with them before them who
will pretend to say that the class who have not produced anything
have added to the aggregate wealth? Whence has come
this increase of wealth? From the wealth producers, from the
labouring classes and from no other source. Industry being the
sole source of wealth, it could have come from no other source.
Hence let the non-producer get his increase by whatever strategy,
it comes in some channel directly from the producer. This may
be done by interest, by speculation, by sharp trades, by profits;
but let it be by which it may, the producer has to pay the bill.
In other words, every addition that is made to the wealth of non-producers
is so made at the expense of the producers, the former
having so much more than they had which they did not produce,
and the latter having so much less than they did produce. This is
self-evident, and all the sophistical argumentation that can ever be
made cannot make it otherwise. The minority may attempt to
explain it away; to show that this and that are so and so; but
here are the facts staring them in the face, and they will no more
down than would Banquo’s ghost for the guilty Thane. There
they stand, an everlasting condemnation of the rule of the minority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and the servitude of the majority. Nothing can be clearer; nothing
truer. And is it not a shame that it is true?</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A PLEA FOR JUSTICE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>You must not mistake me. I would not take a single comfort;
nay, not a single luxury from those who have the most. I would
not deprive anybody of anything they have or want; but I would
so distribute the proceeds of labour that those who produce the
comforts and luxuries should have their share of them; that they
should have everything that the most favoured now enjoy. In
this land of fruitfulness and plenty, if all the labour there is were
constantly employed every man’s home might be a palace, and
want and sorrow be banished from the country. Am I asking too
much for those who have endured long years of toil and suffering
to bring this beautiful country to its present condition? Am I
asking what you are not willing that they shall have? Am I
asking anything more than justice? If you grant them less than
justice God Almighty will come some day, visit you and set the
matter right, as he visited the South and liberated the downtrodden
blacks. So if you do not heed my warning, remember
that there is One whom you cannot ignore.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there is still another way by which the industries are taxed
in favour of the non-producers. The railroads, which ought to be,
and which, managed properly, would be, a great advantage to the
industries, are now at once their blessing and their curse. There
are now 75,000 miles of railways in the country, built at a cost of
$4,658,208,630: their earnings are $404,000,000 annually. But
here is where the people are hoodwinked. This sum does
not begin to represent the actual amount paid by the people for
fare and freights. Almost the whole of the freighting is done by
“lines”—the Red Line, the Blue Line, the White Star Line, and
a hundred others, all which have special contracts with the railroads
to carry freights at just a living rate, while the lines charge
the people all that they can stand to pay, the difference in these
two sums going into the pockets of the owners of the lines. And
who are they? The owners, managers and officers of the railroads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>who resort to this to blind the people’s eyes about the profits of
railroading, which they could not otherwise conceal, because they
are obliged to make annual exhibits. But the lines carry off the
profits, while the operating expenses of the roads, their interests
and dividends are left for the exhibits. If the companies made 20,
30 or 50 per cent. dividends, the people would not stand it:
but the managers play upon them with their lines and blind their
eyes while they pocket the profits.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE RAILROAD SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Then again, there is the system by which the railroads are built,
which is little less than a gigantic swindle. Shrewd persons discover
places where railroads may be built. They obtain charters
and the rights of way, and get the towns along the lines either to
issue or endorse bonds and give them stock in the roads for this.
They sell the bonds to themselves at tremendous discounts and
build the roads, themselves taking the contracts at extravagant
prices, and when done begin to operate them. Of course the
earnings are not sufficient to pay the operating expenses and the
interest, to say nothing about dividends to the stockholders. They
were never intended to be. So after a few defalcations of the
interest on the bonds, they come in and foreclose under the
mortgages and sell out the stockholders and buy in the roads and
thus come into their possession built free of cost to themselves.
Can such processes be rightly called anything less than swindles?
They may be called by some other name, but they still have the
odour of a swindle about them. And yet our best men engage in
such schemes and call them honourable. To speak vulgarly, this
is one of Uncle Sammy Tilden’s best holds. Is it any wonder that
there is so much knavery and trickery among the common classes
upon a small scale, when they have such examples set them by the
upper classes on gigantic scales? or is it any wonder that the
public morals are at so low an ebb? So, examine where we may
into the schemes for the accommodation of the public, we find
them to be vampires sucking its life.</p>

<p class='c009'>How long do the railroad men imagine that the people will endure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>their exactions? Should they not know that their scheming will
have to come to an end soon? Then why do they not act the
part of wise men, and anticipate its coming in time to save themselves?
If they do not, the people will sooner or later take the
roads from them. It may be said that there is no constitutional
or legal way in which this can be done, and they may rest upon
this as secure protection. But I would recall the words of Charles
Sumner, “Anything that is for the public good is constitutional,”
and warn them not to rely upon so slim protection. This was the
argument of King George and of slavery; but it failed them both,
as it will fail every wrong that relies upon it. The people and the
public welfare always triumph in the end; and the longer the
triumph is delayed, the more fearful is the recompense for those
who stand in its way.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE FEAR OF COMMUNISM.</h3>

<p class='c008'>But it may be objected that all this tends towards communism.
Only bigots and the unthinking are frightened by a name or a
shadow from an examination into anything. Perhaps at first
it will create surprise when I tell you that the only really good
institutions that we have are purely communistic. The public
highways are a perfect illustration of communism. They are constructed
and maintained at the public expense for the public benefit.
All grades of people meet upon them on an equality, and yet
no one either loses his identity in the mass or is deprived of any of
his private rights, or of any of his personalities. But the principles
upon which the industries are conducted and that govern their relations
to wealth, the poor man who owns no property, would have
no right to use the highways. The same is true of the public
schools. The children of the rich, who, it is falsely pretended, pay
the taxes to support the schools, and the children of the poor there
meet upon an equality. The schools are not a public necessity,
they are only a public good. Who will pretend to say that they
are not an improvement on the old system, of every family conducting
its own education, or of a few families combining to do so?
Everybody recognises the public advantage of a communal basis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>for the education of all the children; recognises that the public
good demands that the community shall not only provide school
privileges, but shall insist on every child having the benefit of them,
not for the good of the child so much, as for the community’s own
good. Now this is communism. Why are you not frightened at the
communistic tendencies of the public schools? Because, without
thinking them to be communistic, you have adopted them and
found them to be good.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next is the post-office—a still better illustration in an industrial
sense. Here the Government conducts the business of the people.
If the system were maintained wholly instead of partially from the
public treasury, it would be purely communistic. Is there anyone
who is prepared to say that the postal system is not an improvement
on the transmission of letters by private enterprise? And
yet nobody is affrighted at the communistic character of the
modern post-office. Suppose that this system were extended to the
transportation of everything that is interchanged among the people,
have we not a right to assume that the same beneficent results
that have followed the development of the public mails would also
follow there? We have not only the right to assume, but we have
the reason to know that it would, and that the railroad question
and railroad wars would be for ever settled by such an advance
towards communism, and an immense stride be made towards the
organization of the industries as a whole; and this is what we have
done industrially.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ELEMENTS OF OUR POPULATION.</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is an instructive lesson to analyse the population of the
country, to resolve it into the several classes. First, from the
44,000,000, there are to be taken the classes that count for nothing—the
Indians, the Chinese, and the women, for though they are
permitted to live in the country, they form no part of the sovereignty.
“They are,” as Justice Carter asserted when endeavouring
to prove that women are not entitled to the ballot, “citizens in
whom citizenship is dormant.” In round numbers these classes
are 23,000,000. Of the remaining 21,000,000, 11,000,000 are
adults, who are the sovereignty, and who conduct the Government.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Of these 3,000,000 are farmers; 2,000,000 are manufacturers,
mechanics, miners, and lumbermen; 1,000,000 are unskilled
labourers; 1,000,000 are merchants of all kinds, including
dispensers of leaf and liquid damnation; 1,000,000 are gentlemen
of ease who live by their wits—their sharpness and shrewdness—bond-holders,
money-lenders, landlords, gamblers, confidence men,
etc., etc.; 500,000 are clerks; 250,000 are permanent invalids;
200,000, criminals; 100,000, paupers; 100,000, insane; 100,000,
weakminded; 100,000, professional teachers; 100,000, employes of
the national Government; 100,000, of the State, county and municipal
Governments; 90,000, physicians; 60,000, ministers; 50,000,
lawyers, and 50,000, editors and professional writers and actors. A
large part of the property of the farmers is mortgaged to the
money-lenders, and the same is true of the manufacturers, while
the liabilities of the merchants exceed their assets. So, really, the
5th class—the gentlemen of ease—either own or else hold mortgages
on the whole property of the country. It is said that the
curse of England is that 3&thinsp;4ths of its property is owned by forty
families. How much less is true of this country? Can such a
state of injustice as this continue? And if it cannot, what shall take
its place? It is time that those who hold the wealth, should, for
their own sake, be asking this question seriously, unless they would
incur the risk of having it answered for them, as the same was
answered in France in ’93. Public injustice, unless remedied
peaceably, always has terminated in revolution; and it will continue
so to terminate as long as it is not remedied in a wiser way
by those who have the power to do it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?</h3>

<p class='c008'>If it were to be asked what should be done at once to remedy
the present exigencies of suffering labour, I will answer what I
would do had I the power. I would first abolish legal interest and
make it a crime as the Bible does to take usury in any form. I
would stop the payment of interest of the public debt and use the
money to set the unemployed and starving labourers at work on
internal improvements, and should be justified by the people for
doing so; because it would be right to prevent widespread suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and revolution at the expense of such a step; I would build the
Pacific railroads north and south for the people and not give them
to individuals, as was the case with those already built; I would
construct immense workshops in every State in which the skilled
labour of both sexes might be utilised when otherwise unemployed,
because every day that any labourer is idle is a loss to the prospective
wealth of the country; which fact is the condemnation of
the policy of throwing men out of employment whenever business
is depressed. Every labourer thus made idle adds to the general
distress, because from being a producer he becomes a consumer; I
would abolish pauperism and crime by giving everybody a chance
to work at his chosen occupation; but if he preferred to starve
rather than to work I would let him starve; I would purge the
country of rascals by removing the inducements to rascality; I
would make it impossible for a dishonourable person to live in a
community, by placing everybody upon his honour, and in this
way abolish jails and penitentiaries, criminals and courts and
lawyers; I would remove the protection of the law from debts, and
leave them to stand or fall upon the honour or want of it in the
contracting parties, the result of which would be that a failure to
pay once would discredit one for all future time, and compel
honesty as a necessity for existence, making it to the interests of
the people to be honourable in all things; and this, in turn, would
abolish all civil courts and lawyers with all their <i>attachés</i> and
expenses. I would restore to the public the gold, silver, copper,
iron, lead, coal, oil and salt lands and mines and work them for
its benefit, and I would send everybody who should be found tampering
with the public funds to the Dry Tortugus for life.
Yes; had I the power, I would make both compulsory and voluntary
idleness impossible, and wipe out the stain of millions starving
idle in a land of plenty, capable of sustaining a thousand million
people; and hush the wail of suffering that floats upon the winds
from every section of this God-favoured land, but now reeling
under the effects of vicious legislation; I would snatch the people
from being pushed headlong into revolution, and restore to them
the equal use of God’s free gifts to all His children.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>A LAW-GIVER NEEDED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This country having fallen into the errors to which I have referred;
into the hands of mediocre and incompetent legislators, without even
a single statesman among them all; into the times of small minds
and smaller measures that do not look beyond the day in which
they are proposed; into industrial, financial and commercial ruin,
with one half the wealth-producing power starving in idleness and
no one seeming even to think what the end of this must be; having
fallen into all these ills, this country needs that a giant mind shall
spring into its councils, or else among its legislators, a captain which
shall be able to grasp the helm of the ship of state now floundering
hopelessly in the trough of the industrial sea, and put her
before the wind again; a mind that shall have the wisdom and the
courage to show the puerility of those who occupy the posts of
honour, and, by the mere force of will, lift them into the right
path; show them that beneath the surface of that which they
seem to think is peaceable enough, there is a raging, seething
volcano ready at the slightest occasion to burst forth and
overwhelm everything in its path; a master mind which shall compel
Congress by active measures to guide its powers rather than by
inaction to provoke an eruption. This country needs that God
shall send a law-giver; one who shall understand what has
led to the present situation; what the exigencies of the people
demand, and who shall have the ability to propose and the power
to enforce the needed remedies—a Lycurgus to give a new code of
laws that shall be the incarnation of the principles of the Declaration
of Independence, which alone of all principles have any
influence to mould the people, and from which they draw the
characteristics which distinguish them from the other nations of
the earth; and a Bonaparte to sweep out of the way the accumulating
<i>débris</i> of years of vicious legislation and in its place
inaugurate that code; needs a Lycurgus with his code of laws; a
Bonaparte with his genius to command, and, combined with these,
the vehement power of a Demosthenes to rouse the people to a
sense of the danger in which they stand and, whether they will or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>not, lead them through a peaceable, rather than permit them to
plunge into a bloody, revolution. Let this be done, no matter in
what form this power may come, and a change of greater magnitude
for good to this people than that proposed by Lycurgus for
the Spartans, or that instituted in France by Bonaparte, will be
inaugurated here.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what has been done socially? Much of which I have not
the time to speak, but this, as to what I would have for the social
condition:—</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WORDS TO WOMEN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>If the evils of industry were removed a great many social ills
would cease. For instance, if women were independent, industrial
members of the community, they would never be forced into distasteful,
ill-assorted or convenient marriages, which are the most
fruitful of all the sources of vice and crime in children, and consequently
in the community. But beyond the industrial and dependent
relations of the sexes there are many purely social ills that as
much as those of industry require a remedy. Marriage is regarded
as a too frivolous matter; is rushed into and out of in a haste that
shows utter ignorance or else a total disregard for its responsibilities,
and as if it were an institution specially designed for the
benefit of the selfish wishes and passions of the sexes. But to
look at marriage in this light is to not see it at all in that of the
public good, or ultimately, in that of individual happiness.
Marriages that are based upon selfishness or passion can never
result in anything save misery to all concerned. Men and women
who cannot look above these interests, who do not recognize that
these interests should be secondary; who, after finding that their
personal feelings would lead them to marry, cannot coolly ask
themselves, are we prepared to become God’s architects to create
His images, and be governed by the truthful reply, are not fit to
marry. Many have the idea that I am opposed to marriage, but
nothing could be further from the truth. I am opposed to improper
marriages only; to marriages that bring unhappiness to the
married, and misery to their fruits; and such as do this, had I the
power, I would prohibit. I would guard the door by which this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>state is entered with all the vigilance with which the young mother
watches her first-born darling babe; I would have no one enter
its precincts save on bended knee and with prayerful heart, as if
approaching the throne of God; as if to enter there were to more
than in any other way to give one’s self to the service of God. So
strictly would I guard it that none who should once enter could
ever wish to retrace their steps. I would make divorces an unknown
thing by abolishing imprudent and ill-assorted marriages.
I would make the stigma so great that woman should find it impossible
to confront the world in a marriage for a home, for position,
or for any reason save love alone; and I would have her who
should sell her person to be degraded in marriage, as culpable, as
guilty, as impure at heart, as she is held to be who sells it otherwise.
I would put every influence of the community against impure
relations and selfish purposes, in whatever form they might
exist, and encourage honour, purity, virtue and chastity. I would
take away from marriage the idea that it legally conveys the
control of the person of the wife to the husband, and I would make
her as much its guardian against improper use as she is supposed
to be in maidenhood. It should be her own, sacredly, never to be
desecrated by an unwelcome touch. I would make enforced commerce
as much a crime in marriage as it is now out of it, and
unwilling child-bearing a double crime. As the architects of
humanity, I would hold mothers responsible for the character and
perfection of their works; make them realize that they can make
their children what they ought to be, every one of them God’s
image in equality. I would have them come to know that their bodies
are the temples of God, and that within their inner sanctuaries,
within “the holy of holies” God performs his most marvellous
creations; that it is there that God Himself dwells, there that He
will make Himself manifest to man, and that every act that He
does not inspire is sacrilege, is worship of the Evil One, while
every other, is an offering of sweet incense to the Heavenly
Father. I would have man so honour woman that an impure or
improper thought, or a self desire other than a wish to bless her,
could never enter in his heart, would have him hold her to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the holy temple to which God has appointed him to be High
Priest, as elaborately set forth by St. Paul in Hebrews, as the
Garden of Eden into which the Lord God put him, “to dress it
and to keep it,” forbidding him to eat of the fruit of the tree that
stands in the midst of the garden; would have him awake to the
consciousness that, by not so regarding her, he is repeating the sin
of Adam, and by not compelling him to so regard her, she is
repeating the sin of Eve; and that by these sins they are thrust
out of the garden, and prevented from eating of the fruit of the
tree of life and living forever; more than this, I would enlarge the
sphere of parental responsibility so that they should be held
accountable for the instruction of their children in all of the
mysteries of sex, so that none could go into marriage in ignorance
of the laws and uses of the reproductive functions. I would rob
the subject of the mawkish sentimentality in which it is submerged,
and make it a common and proper matter for earnest consideration
and complete understanding. Indeed, I would make it a crime to
enter marriage in ignorance of any of its possible duties and
responsibilities; and twice a crime to bear improper children, for
they who, to satisfy their own propensities, bring children into the
world marked with the brand of Cain or Judas, are the worst kind
of criminals. I would frown upon prostitution in every form; and
make promiscuousness an abomination in the sight of man as it is
in the sight of God; and I would drive out of the race the morbid
passions that are consuming it. I would stop marrying until it
should be no longer done in ignorance; and child-bearing until it
could be done intelligently, so that every child might be a son or
else a daughter of the living God. And I would have every
woman remember the injunction of St. Paul, “Wives, submit
yourselves unto your own husband as it is fit in the Lord,” but in
no other way; and men, “Husbands, love your wives and be not
bitter against them.” And if there be any other things let St.
Paul also speak for me of them. “Whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be
any praise, think on these things.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>NOTES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Lycurgus</span>—“considering education to be the most important and the noblest
work of a law-giver, he began at the very beginning and regulated marriages and
the birth of children.... He strengthened the bodies of the girls by
exercise in running, wrestling, and hurling quoits or javelins, in order that their
children might spring from a healthy source and so grow up strong, and that
they themselves might have strength, so as easily to endure the pains of childbirth.
He did away with all affectation of seclusion and retirement among the
women, and ordained that the girls, no less than the boys, should go naked in processions,
and dance and sing at festivals in the presence of the young men. The
jokes which they made upon each man were sometimes of great value as reproofs
for ill-conduct; while on the other hand, by reciting verses written in praise of
the deserving, they kindled a wonderful emulation and thirst for distinction in
the young men: for he who had been praised by the maidens for his valour went
away congratulated by his friends; while on the other hand, the raillery which
they used in sport or jest had as keen an edge as a serious reproof; because the
kings and elders were present at these festivals as well as all the other citizens.
This nakedness of the maidens had in it nothing disgraceful, as it was done
modestly, not licentiously (as in ballet dances and music halls and ball-rooms of
the present day), producing simplicity, and <i>teaching</i> the women to <i>value good health</i>,
and to love honour and courage no less than the men. This it was that made
them speak and think as we are told Gorgo, the wife of Leonidas, did. Some
foreign lady, it seems, said to her, ‘You Laconian women are the only ones that
rule men....’ She answered, ‘Yes; for we alone bring forth men....’
They considered that if a child did not start in possession of health and strength,
it was better for itself and for the State that it should not live at all.”—<cite>Plutarch’s
Life of Lycurgus, Bohn’s Standard Library.</cite></p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c009'>Lycurgus did not view children as belonging to their parents, but above all
to the state; and therefore he wished his citizens to be born of the best possible
parents; besides the inconsistency and folly which he noticed in the customs of
the rest of mankind, who are willing to pay money, or use their influence with
the owners of well-bred stock, to obtain a good breed of horses or dogs, while
they lock up their women in seclusion and permit them to have children by none
but themselves, even though they be mad, decrepit, or diseased; just as if the
good or bad qualities of children did not depend entirely upon their parents, and
did not affect their parents more than anyone else.... Adultery
was regarded amongst them as an impossible crime.... The training
of the Spartan youth continued till their manhood. No one was permitted to
live according to his own pleasure, but they lived in the city as if in a camp,
with a fixed diet and public duties, thinking themselves to belong not to themselves
but to their country.... Lycurgus would not entrust Spartan
boys to any <i>bought</i> or <i>hired servants</i> nor was each man allowed to bring up and
educate his son as he chose, but as soon as they were seven years of age he
himself received them from their parents, and enrolled them in companies. A
superintendent of the boys was appointed, one of the best born and bravest of
the state.... The boys were taught to compress much thought in few
words; though Lycurgus made the iron-money of little value he made their
speech have great value. One of his great reforms was the common dining-table....
In Sparta, as was natural, lawsuits became extinct, together with
money, as the people had neither excess nor deficiency, but were all equally well
off, and enjoyed abundant leisure by reason of their simple habits.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
